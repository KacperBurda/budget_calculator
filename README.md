This is a solution written 100% by me for the FreeCodeCamp exercise: Boilerplate Budget.

You can add, withdraw funds within the objects and transfer money from one object to another. By printing the object, a special chart is shown
with all of the operations. 
Also there is additional function, that takes all of the withdraws from all of the objects and displays percentage chart.

I've made some improvments mostly with readability, but also I've used dataclass and expanded spend chart functionality to show chart for more than 4 objects.
I've also added more tests and exception handling.
